# ðŸ“Š Power Consumption Forecasting â€“ Tetouan City Zone 1

## Objective
Empowering energy stakeholders with **data-driven insights** for smarter power demand forecasting and proactive energy management in **Zone 1 of Tetouan City**.

---

## ðŸ”¥ Key Highlights
- **Model Used:** Random Forest Regressor  
- **Performance:** RÂ² score of **0.975** (explains 97.5% of demand variability)  
- **Business Value:**  
  - Accurate power demand forecasting  
  - Smarter resource planning and load management  
  - Strategic energy provision and operational efficiency  

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Data Overview
- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository  
- **Frequency:** Data collected every 10 minutes  
- **Features:**
  - **Environmental Factors:** Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, Diffuse Flows  
  - **Power Consumption Data:** Zone 1 (Target), Zone 2 & Zone 3 (Reference)  

---

## ðŸ’¡ Key Business Insights
- **Stable High Demand in Zone 1:** Indicates critical operational usage.  
- **Seasonality & Weather Impact:** Usage correlates with humidity, diffuse flows, and wind speed (temperature was not a key factor).  
- **Cross-Zone Influence:** Power usage in Zone 2 & 3 strongly relates to Zone 1 demand.  

---

## âœ… Recommendations
- Deploy the model in **daily and weekly operations**.  
- Integrate forecasts with **real-time monitoring dashboards**.  
- Explore advanced ensemble models (e.g., **XGBoost**) for further optimization.  
- Regularly **update and maintain** the model with new data.  
- Consider **scaling the approach city-wide** for comprehensive energy planning.
